The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 19.0.1 release.

This release primarily addresses a bug in the recent Arrow 19.0.0 release which
prevents Arrow C++ and libraries binding it (e.g., Python, R) from reading
Parquet files created by Arrow Rust v53.0.0 or more recent. See the [19.0.0
release blog post][4] for more information.

This release includes [**12 resolved issues**][1] from [**9 distinct
contributors**][2]. See the [Install Page][5] to learn how to get the libraries for
your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## C++ notes

## Python notes

- A bug has been fixed on the integration with Pandas when using `future.infer_string=True` for Pandas 2.2 ([#45296](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45296)).
