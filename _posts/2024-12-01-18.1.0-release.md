The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 18.1.0 release. This
covers roughly one month of development work and includes [**15 resolved
issues**][1] on [**25 distinct commits**][2] from [**8 distinct
contributors**][2]. See the [Install Page](https://arrow.apache.org/install/) to
learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

The primary motivation for this minor release was to address packaging issues
for Python, Java, C#, R and MATLAB which caused binaries for those platforms to
report a version of `18.0.0-SNAPSHOT` instead of `18.0.0`. The affected binaries
were otherwise built correctly. See [this mailing list
post](https://lists.apache.org/thread/t8k7l2hsbgdt7cszj7hrpjdfpn91n5zb) for more
details.
