The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 19.0.0 release. This release
covers over 2 months of development work and includes [**202 resolved
issues**][1] on [**330 distinct commits**][2] from [**67 distinct
contributors**][2]. See the [Install Page](https://arrow.apache.org/install/) to
learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 18.1.0 release, Adam Reeve and Laurent Goujon have been invited to
become committers. Gang Wu has been invited to join the Project Management
Committee (PMC).

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Columnar format

We've added a new experimental specification for statistics schema. It's useful
to exchange statistics. See [the statistics schema
documentation](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/StatisticsSchema.html) for
details.

There's also an expansion of the C Device ABI to include an experimental Async
Device Stream Interface. While the existing C Device Interface is a
pull-oriented API, the Async interface provides a push-oriented design for other
workflows. See the
[documentation](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDeviceDataInterface.html#async-device-stream-interface)
for more information. It currently has implementations in the C++ and Go
libraries.

## Arrow Flight RPC notes

- The precision of a Timestamp (used for timeouts) is now nanoseconds on all platforms; previously it was platform-dependent. ([#44679](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44679))
- The Python bindings now support various new fields that were added to FlightEndpoint/FlightInfo (like `expiration_time`). ([#36954](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36954))

## C++ notes

### Compute

It is now possible to cast from a struct type to another struct type with
additional columns, provided the additional columns are nullable (GH-44555).

The compute function `expm1` has been added to compute `exp(x) - 1` with better
accuracy when the input value is close to 0 (GH-44903).

Hyperbolic trigonometric functions and their reciprocals have also been added
(GH-44952).

### Acero

Added AVX2 support for decoding row tables in the Swiss join specialization of
hash joins, enabling up to 40% performance improvement for build-heavy workloads
([GH-43693](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43693)).

### Filesystems

The S3 filesystem has gained support for server-side encryption with customer
provided keys, aka SSE-C (GH-43535).

The S3 filesystem also gained an option to disable the SIGPIPE signals that may
be emitted on some network events (GH-44695).

The Azure filesystem now supports SAS token authentication (GH-44308).

### Flight RPC

- The precision of a Timestamp (used for timeouts) is now nanoseconds on all
  platforms; previously it was platform-dependent.
  ([#44679](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44679))
- The Python bindings now support various new fields that were added to
  FlightEndpoint/FlightInfo (like `expiration_time`).
  ([#36954](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36954))
- The UCX backend has been deprecated and is scheduled for removal.
  ([GH-45079](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/)).

### Memory management

Mimalloc is now the default allocator, while jemalloc is disabled by default
due to reports of compatibility issues on various platforms (GH-44976). While
we do not expect this to cause any functional regression, it may lead to different
memory consumption and performance characteristics in memory-intensive workloads.

### Parquet

The initial footer read size can now be configured to reduce the number of
potential roundtrips on high-latency filesystems such as S3 (GH-45015).

The new SizeStatistics format feature has been implemented, though it is
disabled by default when writing (GH-40592).

### Miscellaneous

`ChunkResolver` is now exposed as a public API (GH-34535).

## C# notes

* The `PrimitiveArrayBuilder` constructor has been made public to allow writing custom builders ([#23995](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/23995))
* Improved the performance of looking up schema fields by name ([#44575](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44575))

## Java notes

The Java project has moved to a separate repository outside the main Arrow
monorepo. For notes on the latest release of the Java implementation, see the
latest [Arrow Java changelog][7].

## Python notes

TODO

## Ruby and C GLib notes

### Ruby

- Added basic support for JRuby with an implementation based on Arrow Java
  ([GH-44346](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/44346)). The plan is to release
  this as a gem once it covers a base set of features. See
  [GH-45324](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45324) for more information.
- Added support for 32bit and 64bit decimal, binary view, and string view. See
  [issues
  listed](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues?q=is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A19.0.0%20label%3A%22Component%3A%20GLib%22)
  in the 19.0.0 milestone.
- Fixed a bug that empty struct list can't be built
  ([GH-44742](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44742))
- Fixed a bug that `record_batch[:colun].size` raises an exception
  ([GH-45119](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45119))

### C GLib

- Added support for 32bit and 64bit decimal, binary view, and string view. See
  [issues
  listed](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues?q=is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A19.0.0%20label%3A%22Component%3A%20GLib%22)
  in the 19.0.0 milestone.

## Rust notes and Go notes

The Rust and Go projects have moved to separate repositories outside the main
Arrow monorepo. For notes on the latest release of the Rust implementation, see
the latest [Arrow Rust changelog][5]. For notes on the latest release of the Go
implementation, see the latest [Arrow Go changelog][6]

## Linux packages notes

- Debian: Fixed keyring format to support newer libapt (e.g., that used by
  Trixie) ([GH-45118](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45118))
