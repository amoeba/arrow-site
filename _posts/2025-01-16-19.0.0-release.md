The Apache Arrow team is pleased to announce the 19.0.0 release. This release
covers over 2 months of development work and includes [**202 resolved
issues**][1] on [**330 distinct commits**][2] from [**67 distinct
contributors**][2]. See the [Install Page](https://arrow.apache.org/install/) to
learn how to get the libraries for your platform.

The release notes below are not exhaustive and only expose selected highlights
of the release. Many other bugfixes and improvements have been made: we refer
you to the [complete changelog][3].

## Community

Since the 18.1.0 release, Adam Reeve and Laurent Goujon have been invited to
become committers. Gang Wu has been invited to join the Project Management
Committee (PMC).

Thanks for your contributions and participation in the project!

## Release Highlights

A [bug](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45283) has been identified in the
19.0.0 versions of the C++ and Python libraries which prevents reading Parquet
files written by Arrow Rust v53.0.0 or higher. The files written by Arrow Rust
are correct and the bug was in the patch adding support for Parquet's
[SizeStatistics](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/pull/197) feature to
Arrow C++ and Python. See [#45293](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45283)
for more details including a potential workaround.

As a result, we plan to create a 19.0.1 release to include a fix for this which
should be available in next few weeks.

## Columnar Format

We've added a new experimental specification for representing statistics on
Arrow Arrays as Arrow Arrays. This is useful for preserving and exchanging
statistics between systems such as when converting Parquet data to Arrow. See
[the statistics schema
documentation](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/StatisticsSchema.html) for
details.

We've expanded the Arrow C Device Data Interface to include an experimental
Async Device Stream Interface. While the existing Arrow C Device Data Interface
is a pull-oriented API, the Async interface provides a push-oriented design for
other workflows. See the
[documentation](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDeviceDataInterface.html#async-device-stream-interface)
for more information. It currently has implementations in the C++ and Go
libraries.

## Arrow Flight RPC Notes

The precision of a Timestamp (used for timeouts) is now nanoseconds on all
platforms; previously it was platform-dependent. This may be a breaking change
depending on your use case.
([#44679](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44679))

The Python bindings now support various new fields that were added to
FlightEndpoint/FlightInfo (like `expiration_time`).
([#36954](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36954))

## C++ Notes

### Compute

- It is now possible to cast from a struct type to another struct type with
additional columns, provided the additional columns are nullable
([#44555)](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44555).
- The compute function `expm1` has been added to compute `exp(x) - 1` with better
accuracy when the input value is close to 0
([#44903](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44903)).
- Hyperbolic trigonometric functions and their reciprocals have also been added.
([#44952](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44952)).
- The new Decimal32 and Decimal64 types have been further supported by allowing
casting between numeric, string, and other decimal types
([#43956](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43956)).

### Acero

- Added AVX2 support for decoding row tables in the Swiss join specialization of
hash joins, enabling up to 40% performance improvement for build-heavy
workloads. ([#43693](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43693))

### Filesystems

- The S3 filesystem has gained support for server-side encryption with customer
provided keys, aka SSE-C.
([#43535](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43535))
- The S3 filesystem also gained an option to disable the SIGPIPE signals that
may be emitted on some network events.
([#44695](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44695))
- The Azure filesystem now supports SAS token authentication.
([#44308](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44308)).

### Flight RPC

- The precision of a Timestamp (used for timeouts) is now nanoseconds on all
  platforms; previously it was platform-dependent. This may be a breaking change
depending on your use case.
  ([#44679](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44679))
- The Python bindings now support various new fields that were added to
  FlightEndpoint/FlightInfo (like `expiration_time`).
  ([#36954](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36954))
- The UCX backend has been deprecated and is scheduled for removal.
  ([#45079](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45079))

### Parquet

- The initial footer read size can now be configured to reduce the number of
potential round-trips on hi-latency filesystems such as S3.
([#45015](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45015))
- The new `SizeStatistics` format feature has been implemented, though it is
disabled by default when writing.
([#40592](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/40592))
- We've added a new method to the ParquetFileReader class,
[GetReadRanges](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/formats.html#_CPPv4N7parquet17ParquetFileReader13GetReadRangesERKNSt6vectorIiEERKNSt6vectorIiEE7int64_t7int64_t),
which can calculate the byte ranges necessary to read a given set of columns and
row groups. This may be useful to pre-buffer file data via caching mechanisms.
([#45092](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45092))
- We've added `arrow::Result`-returning variants for
`parquet::arrow::OpenFile()` and
`parquet::arrow::FileReader::GetRecordBatchReader()`.
([#44784](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44784),
[#44808](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44808))

## C# Notes

- The `PrimitiveArrayBuilder` constructor has been made public to allow writing
  custom builders. ([#23995](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/23995))
- Improved the performance of looking up schema fields by name.
  ([#44575](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44575))

## Java, Go, and Rust Notes

The Java, Go, and Rust Go projects have moved to separate repositories outside
the main Arrow [monorepo](https://github.com/apache/arrow).

- For notes on the latest release of the [Java
implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow-java), see the latest [Arrow
Java changelog][7].
- For notes on the latest release of the [Rust
  implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs) see the latest [Arrow Rust
  changelog][5].
- For notes on the latest release of the [Go
implementation](https://github.com/apache/arrow-go), see the latest [Arrow Go
changelog][6].

## Linux Packaging Notes

- Debian: Fixed keyring format to support newer libapt (e.g., used by
  Trixie). ([#45118](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45118))

## Python Notes

New features:

- The upcoming pandas 3.0 [string
  dtype](https://pandas.pydata.org/pdeps/0014-string-dtype.html) is now
  supported by PyArrow's `to_pandas` routine. In the future, when using pandas >=3.0,
  the new pandas behavior will be enabled by default. You can opt into
  the new behavior under pandas >=2.3 by setting `pd.options.future.infer_string
  = True`. This may be considered a breaking change.
  ([#43683](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43683))
- Support for 32-bit and 64-bit decimal types was added.
  ([#44713](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44713))
- Arrow PyCapsule stream objects are supported in `write_dataset`.
  ([#43410](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/43410))
- New Flight features have been exposed.
  ([#36954](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36954))
- Bindings for `JsonExtensionType` and `JsonArray` were added.
  ([#44066](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44066))
- Hyperbolic trigonometry functions added to the Arrow C++ compute kernels are
  also available in PyArrow.
  ([#44952](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44952))

Other improvements:

- `strings_to_categorical` keyword in `to_pandas` can now be used for string
  view type. ([#45175](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45175))
- `from_buffers` is updated to work with `StringView`.
  ([#44651](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44651))
- Version suffixes are also set for Arrow Python C++ (`libarrow_python*`)
  libraries. ([#44614](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44614))

## Ruby and C GLib Notes

### Ruby

- Added basic support for JRuby with an implementation based on Arrow Java
  ([#44346](https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/44346)). The plan is to release
  this as a gem once it covers a base set of features. See
  [#45324](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45324) for more information.
- Added support for 32bit and 64bit decimal, binary view, and string view. See
  [issues
  listed](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues?q=is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A19.0.0%20label%3A%22Component%3A%20GLib%22)
  in the 19.0.0 milestone for more details.
- Fixed a bug that empty struct list can't be built.
  ([#44742](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/44742))
- Fixed a bug that `record_batch[:column].size` raises an exception.
  ([#45119](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/45119))

### C GLib

- Added support for 32bit and 64bit decimal, binary view, and string view. See
  [issues listed in the 19.0.0
